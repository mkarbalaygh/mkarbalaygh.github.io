<h1 style="text-align: center;">About</h1>

<p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 1rem auto; text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1rem;">
  I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in Purdue University, where I am working jointly with 
  <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/~djlove/" target="_blank">Prof. David Love</a> and 
  <a href="https://www.cbrinton.net/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Christopher G. Brinton</a> 
  on different areas of machine learning and information theory with applications in future wireless networks (6G and beyond). Before joining Purdue, I was conducting research at Nokia Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ. I also obtained my PhD in 2024 from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Dallas, advised by Prof. 
  <a href="https://labs.utdallas.edu/aria/" target="_blank">Prof. Aria Nosratinia</a>.
