    I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, working jointly with 
    <strong><a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/~djlove/" target="_blank">Prof. David Love</a></strong> and 
    <strong><a href="https://www.cbrinton.net/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Christopher G. Brinton</a></strong> 
    on broad topics in machine learning and information theory with applications in future wireless networks (6G and beyond).

    Before joining Purdue, I was conducting research at 
    <strong><a href="https://www.nokia.com/bell-labs/" target="_blank">Nokia Bell Labs</a></strong> in Murray Hill, NJ. I received my PhD in 2024 from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I was advised by 
    <strong><a href="https://labs.utdallas.edu/aria/people/dr-aria-nosratinia/" target="_blank">Prof. Aria Nosratinia</a></strong>.
